TODOs for this chapter as there are some things I haven't cleaned up yet.

* Add findByKey() to the TicketCategoryRepository, going all the way back to recipe 13.1

* Update 13.3 to get rid of the REST calls that the help desk app makes to the portal. Get rid of both the client and
  the service. This also means getting rid of the Spring HATEOAS resources and replacing them with our CDM DTOs. Remove
  the dependencies from the POM, remove the REST annotations from the Spring Data JPA repos, etc.

* In recipe 13.3, replace the hardcoded Rabbit guest/guest credentials with property placeholder creds. Do this for
  both help desk and portal. Merge this forward.

* Update the TicketController in earlier recipes to allow null customer usernames, as in recipe 13.4. Sometimes the
  customer username will not be known as when somebody sends in an email. It could be that the support rep has to
  resolve the username somehow, but it could be a prospective customer who doesn't even have a username.
